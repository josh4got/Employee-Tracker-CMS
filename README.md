# Employee Tracker

## Description

Employee Tracker is a CMS(content management system) application that add,stores,and updates employees,roles,and departments in the employee database. This project was made to provide an easy-to-use system for tracking employee information. This project eliminates having to use a seperate software to track employee information such as job title, department, and salary.

This project taught me how to use Node.js and SQL to interact with a database, as well as how to build a command-line interface for managing data.
